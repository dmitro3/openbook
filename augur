So regarding the bets, the most difficult problem arises when user makes two bets in the same match. To solve this Augur uses a very very roundabout solution:

If we go that way it will look like this for us: 

Have a unique struct for each game:

struct Market {
        address settlementAddress;
        BetERC1155[] betTokens;
        uint256 winnerIndex;
        uint256 settlementFee;
        uint256 protocolFee;
        uint256 stakerFee;
        uint256 creationTimestamp;
        uint256 resolutionTimestamp; // when winner is declared
        uint256[] initialOdds;
        bool active; // false if not ready to use or if resolved
    }

If there are 3 outcomes in a game, there will 3 betTokens for that game. For eg if there is Man City VS Liverpool game, the game will have 3 NFT contracts. One is Man City contract, One is draw and another is Liverpool contract

The number of ERC1155 token they own for contract is their expected winning. 


I would rather not use this approach because if we do this we can't show how much they bet, when they bet etc.
